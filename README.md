# ☑️ validate

_Validate_ aims to be a simple to use fluent validation library for TypeScript that doesn't require the use of classes.

**Note**: The library is currently under development and being tailored to be used in [Duets](https://github.com/duets/game) and may not cover every use-case. If you want a feature to be added, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sleepyfran/validate/issues).
